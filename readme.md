**This repo is for demoing the interaction of cherrypicking and merging.**

The question to answer is:
When I cherry-pick a commit that changes a file that does not even exist in the branch I pick it to.
What will happen?

What will happen later on when the branch the pick came from gets merged into the target branch?
Will imformation get lost?

This repo shows, what happend!


**Rest assured, no information is lost.**
